<h3>Flow</h3>

<p>To see one’s own reflection is to get immediate proof of your existence in the here and now—of the space you occupy in the world and perhaps even clues to how the world perceives you. And through that miracle of self-awareness, you may perhaps extend empathy to those around you, also burdened with navigating the perennial compilations of being alive.</p>

<h3>The wild Robot</h3>
<p>Chris Sanders once described his approach to “The Wild Robot” as “a Monet painting in a Miyazaki forest.” As insane as that may sound, he pulled it off.</p>

<h3>Memoir of a Snail</h3>

<p>What’s worse than the shells that other people place us in our lives? The shells that we place on ourselves. This idea of the intangible things that we carry on our backs, like insecurity, depression, grief, and trauma, is at the core of Adam Elliot’s moving stop-motion saga “Memoir of a Snail,” which is unlike any other animated film you will see this year. It’s a gorgeous film, but it’s also an emotionally intelligent movie, one that shifts and flows between comedy and tragedy, reminding us that life can only be lived forward.</p>
