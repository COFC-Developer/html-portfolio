<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Colombian living in the Czech Republic for nearly a decade. Passionate about nature, good food, sports, and staying active, I find great joy in
   maintaining a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. As a practicing Catholic, I am committed to growing in my faith. I also have a deep love for languages—I
   speak Spanish, English, and Portuguese fluently, have a solid grasp of French and Czech, and have recently started learning Polish.

<p>Although I studied Electrical Engineering, my professional journey took a different path. I began in furniture production before transitioning into
  Customer Service in the travel industry. I spent nearly seven rewarding years at Expedia, where I had the privilege of working with incredibly talented
  individuals from around the world. It was there that I truly understood the value of delivering exceptional customer service. Thanks to the inspiring 
  leaders I worked with, I was given the opportunity to grow into leadership roles myself. While I’ve enjoyed my career so far, I’ve discovered a strong 
  interest in more technical and analytical work. This has led me to enroll in an intensive Web Developer Bootcamp, where I’m currently strengthening my 
  foundations and working toward a future role as a Data Analyst.
